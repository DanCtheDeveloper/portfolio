      Directions:
        *DONE 1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content 
        *DONE 2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        *DONE 3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        *DONE 4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        *DONE 5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        *DONE 6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        *DONE 7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        *DONE 8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        *DONE 9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        *DONE 10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        *DONE 11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        *DONE 12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        *DONE 13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        *DONE 14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          *DONE - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          *DONE - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
